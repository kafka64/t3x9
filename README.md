# T3X Native Compiler

This repository contains Linux port of [T3X](https://www.t3x.org/t3x/book.html) compiler by Nils M Holm.

It currently passes the triple compiler test and many small programs seem to work as expected.

I will document gotchas I had to deal with while porting and other points of interest as I add more features in separate document but for fuller explanation of how the compiler works, please consider buying Mr.Holm's book. It is a short but informative book full of wisdoms.

## TODO
[x] ABI compatibility with the Linux operating system.

[ ] T-Code VM bootstrapping compiler image.

[ ] Reach feature parity with T3X9 and pass its test suite.

[ ] Language enhancement : closure? pattern matching?
